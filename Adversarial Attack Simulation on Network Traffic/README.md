## Introduction

Adversarial attacks on network traffic involve manipulating packets in such a way that they bypass detection mechanisms or cause disruptions in communication. This project simulates various types of adversarial attacks on network traffic to help researchers and cybersecurity professionals understand potential vulnerabilities in network security systems.

The scripts provided here aim to:
- Simulate different types of adversarial attacks.
- Analyze the impact of these attacks on network traffic.
- Provide insights into possible defensive measures.

## Features

- **Packet Manipulation**: Modify network packets to simulate adversarial behavior.
- **Traffic Analysis**: Analyze the effects of adversarial attacks on network traffic.
- **Customizable Attacks**: Configure different parameters to simulate a variety of attack scenarios.
- **Visualization Tools**: Generate visualizations to better understand the impact of the attacks.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Scapy (`pip install scapy`)
- Numpy (`pip install numpy`)
- Matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib`)
- Pandas (`pip install pandas`)

Additionally, administrative privileges may be required to capture and modify network packets.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SarveshChand12/Cyber-Security-Projects.git
   cd Cyber-Security-Projects/Adversarial\ Attack\ Simulation\ on\ Network\ Traffic
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Simulation

To run a basic simulation of an adversarial attack on network traffic, execute the main script:

```bash
python adversarial_attack_simulation.py
```

You can customize the attack parameters by editing the configuration file `config.json` or passing arguments directly via the command line.

### Example: Simulating a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack

```bash
python adversarial_attack_simulation.py --attack-type mitm --target-ip 192.168.1.10 --gateway-ip 192.168.1.1
```
