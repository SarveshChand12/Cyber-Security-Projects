# HPC-Based Network Traffic Analyzer

## Overview

The HPC-Based Network Traffic Analyzer is designed to leverage High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources to efficiently monitor and analyze network traffic. This tool aims to provide real-time insights into network performance, detect anomalies, and assist in optimizing network operations within HPC environments.

## Features

- **High-Performance Data Processing**: Utilizes parallel computing techniques to handle large volumes of network traffic data efficiently.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Provides immediate insights into network status, enabling prompt detection of issues.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual patterns in network traffic that may indicate potential security threats or performance bottlenecks.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale with the size of the HPC infrastructure, ensuring consistent performance across various cluster sizes.
