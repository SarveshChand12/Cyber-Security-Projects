# IoT Network Defense with Adversarial Training

This project is part of the [Cyber-Security-Projects](https://github.com/SarveshChand12/Cyber-Security-Projects) repository. It demonstrates how adversarial training techniques can be applied to IoT network defense systems in order to enhance robustness against sophisticated cyberattacks and adversarial perturbations.

## Overview

Internet of Things (IoT) networks are increasingly targeted by cyber adversaries. Traditional intrusion detection systems may be vulnerable when facing adversarial attacks designed to deceive machine learning models. In this project, we implement a defense framework that leverages adversarial training to harden network defense models. By incorporating adversarial examples into the training process, the model learns robust features that help maintain high detection accuracy even when under attack.

## Key Features

- **Adversarial Training:** Integration of adversarial examples into the training process to improve model robustness.
- **Intrusion Detection:** A machine learning model designed to detect malicious traffic and intrusions in IoT networks.
- **Adversarial Example Generation:** Scripts and utilities to generate adversarial perturbations targeting IoT network traffic.
- **Experimentation and Evaluation:** Tools (scripts and notebooks) to train, test, and evaluate defense performance under various attack scenarios.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**  
- **Libraries:**  
  - NumPy  
  - Pandas  
  - scikit-learn  
  - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (depending on your preferred framework)  
  - Other dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SarveshChand12/Cyber-Security-Projects.git
   cd Cyber-Security-Projects/IoT\ Network\ Defense\ with\ Adversarial\ Training
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Use pip to install all required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Training the Defense Model

Run the training script with your chosen configuration. For example:

```bash
python train.py --config config.yaml
```

The configuration file (`config.yaml`) contains settings for network architecture, hyperparameters, dataset paths, and adversarial training options.

### Generating Adversarial Examples

To test the robustness of your model, generate adversarial examples using:

```bash
python generate_adversarial.py --model saved_model.pth --data data/test_data.csv
```

*(Adjust the command line options as needed to match your environment.)*

### Evaluating the Model

Evaluate the performance of your trained model on test data with:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model saved_model.pth --test_data data/test_data.csv
```

This script computes standard metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score) and logs the performance under adversarial scenarios.
