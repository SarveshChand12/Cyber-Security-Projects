The "Real-Time Malware Detection on GPU Clusters" project aims to develop an efficient and scalable system for detecting malware in real-time using GPU clusters. By leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs, the project seeks to enhance the speed and accuracy of malware detection, making it suitable for large-scale network environments.

**Key Features:**

- **GPU-Accelerated Detection:** Utilizes GPU clusters to process and analyze large volumes of data swiftly, enabling real-time malware detection.

- **Scalability:** Designed to scale across multiple GPUs, accommodating the growing demands of modern network traffic.

- **High Accuracy:** Employs advanced machine learning algorithms to achieve high detection accuracy, minimizing false positives and negatives.

**Prerequisites:**

- **Hardware:** Access to GPU clusters with CUDA support.

- **Software:**
  - **Operating System:** Linux-based systems are recommended.
  - **CUDA Toolkit:** Version 11.0 or higher.
  - **cuDNN:** Version 8.0 or higher.
  - **Python:** Version 3.8 or higher.
  - **Libraries:**
    - TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the implementation).
    - NumPy
    - Pandas
    - Scikit-learn

**Installation:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SarveshChand12/Cyber-Security-Projects.git
   cd Cyber-Security-Projects/Real-Time\ Malware\ Detection\ on\ GPU\ Clusters
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**Usage:**

1. **Prepare the Dataset:**

   Ensure that the malware dataset is in the required format (e.g., CSV, JSON). Place the dataset in the `data/` directory.

2. **Train the Model:**

   ```bash
   python train.py --data_path data/malware_dataset.csv --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
   ```

   Adjust the `--data_path`, `--epochs`, and `--batch_size` parameters as needed.

3. **Evaluate the Model:**

   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --model_path models/malware_detection_model.h5 --data_path data/test_dataset.csv
   ```

   Replace `models/malware_detection_model.h5` and `data/test_dataset.csv` with the appropriate paths to your trained model and test dataset.
