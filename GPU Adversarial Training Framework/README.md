# GPU Adversarial Training Framework

## Overview

The GPU Adversarial Training Framework is designed to enhance the robustness of machine learning models against adversarial attacks by leveraging GPU acceleration. This framework facilitates efficient adversarial training, allowing models to better withstand malicious perturbations.

## Features

- **Efficient Adversarial Training**: Utilizes GPU acceleration to expedite the training process, enabling the handling of large datasets and complex models.
- **Modular Design**: Offers a flexible architecture, allowing users to customize and extend components as needed.
- **Support for Multiple Attacks**: Implements various adversarial attack methods to test and improve model robustness.

## Requirements

- **Hardware**: A CUDA-compatible GPU is recommended for optimal performance.
- **Software**:
  - Python 3.6 or higher
  - PyTorch
  - CUDA Toolkit (if using GPU acceleration)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SarveshChand12/Cyber-Security-Projects.git
   cd Cyber-Security-Projects/Explainable AI for Cybersecurity
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare Your Dataset**: Ensure your dataset is formatted appropriately for training and evaluation.

2. **Configure Training Parameters**: Adjust settings such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs in the configuration file or script.

3. **Run the Training Script**:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

   This will initiate the adversarial training process using the specified parameters.

4. **Evaluate Model Robustness**: After training, use the evaluation scripts to assess the model's performance against various adversarial attacks.
